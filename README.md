# Traffic Analysis Assignment

## Overview

This assignment focuses on analyzing vehicle traffic data using Python and data visualization techniques. 
The goal is to explore the distribution of vehicle counts, traffic situations, and their variations across different timeframes using Google Colab or any preferred tool.
The dataset provided contains information on various vehicle types, traffic situations, and timestamps.

## Libraries

* Python: For data analysis and visualization.

* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visual representations of data.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this assignment, you will have a comprehensive understanding of traffic patterns, vehicle distributions,
and their relationships with traffic situations over time. Your ability to interpret data through visualization will be enhanced, preparing you for more advanced analytical tasks in data science.
